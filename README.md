# Bell

Bell is a simple script for describing and making API calls. 

## Advantages

- Bell files are easy to read: unlike Postman which buries important information in various menus
- Bell files are easy to run: a simple CLI or VSCode plugin can run Bell files
- Bell is collaborative by default: make a `/bell` folder in your project repo and use git to keep the team on track. This also makes Bell files easy to track down.

## Project

The project is divided into three parts

- New file type with documentation
- Command Line Tool for executing Bell files
- VSCode plugin with syntax highlighting, error flags, and simple GUI
