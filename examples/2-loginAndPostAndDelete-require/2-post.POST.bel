at the beginning, say that we require token to be defined
notice that we could use import instead
however import runs the file associated with the import
require simply ensures that this variable has been set by the time this file is run
###

require token

url 'localhost:4000/post'

headers
{
  Authorization: `Bearer: ${token}`
} 

body {
  test: input("Write a post")
}

POST
